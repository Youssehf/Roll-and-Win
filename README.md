# Roll Game ðŸŽ²

Welcome to the **Roll Game**, a simple two-player game where players take turns rolling a dice. The first player to reach or exceed a score of 10 wins the game. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose their current score for that round and the turn switches to the other player.

## How to Play

1. **New Game**: Click the "ðŸ”„ New Game" button to reset the game.
2. **Roll Dice**: Click the "ðŸŽ² Roll Dice" button to roll the dice. If you roll a number between 2 and 6, it adds to your current score. If you roll a 1, your current score is lost and it's the next player's turn.
3. **Hold**: Click the "ðŸ“¥ Hold" button to add your current score to your total score and pass the turn to the next player.
4. **Winning**: The first player to reach a total score of 10 or more wins the game. A congratulatory message will appear when the game ends.
